# Asset Quality Check (QC)

Framework designed to collect, validate and report asset data for Animation and Visual Effects applications.

This framework is agnostic to software application but was primarily designed with Autodesk Maya in mind. Other software applications may work, but are currently untested.

assetQC is written in Python and is easily extendable. The tests contain simple examples for a (non-functioning) computer graphics pipeline.

This Python module is not an end-user tool, but a framework people can use as a basis for data validation.

## Features:

- Asset data validation using custom written tests.
- Automatic finding of assets (collection) using custom written functions.
- Upon invalid data being found, custom functions can be run to attempt an automatic data fix / clean. 
- Reporting framework to return validation details.
- Per-asset exception handling framework
- Example tests for a rudimentary computer graphics pipeline.
